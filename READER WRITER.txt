/*         Implement reader writer problem 
The Problem Statement 
There is a shared resource which should be accessed by multiple processes.  
There are two types of processes in this context. They are reader and writer.  
Any number of readers can read from the shared resource simultaneously, but only  
one writer can write to the shared resource. When a writer is writing data to the  
resource, no other process can access the resource. A writer cannot write to the  
resource if there are non zero number of readers accessing the resource at that time.
