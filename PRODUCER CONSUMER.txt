/* 
Implement Producer &Consumer problem using semaphore. 
Producer consumer problem is also known as bounded buffer problem. In this problem we have two processes,4 
producer and consumer, who share a fixed size buffer. Producer work is to produce data or items and put  
in buffer. Consumer work is to remove data from buffer and consume it. We have to make sure that producer  
do not produce data when buffer is full and consumer do not remove data when buffer is empty. 
To solve this problem, we need two counting semaphores – Full and Empty. “Full” keeps track of number of  
items in the buffer at any given time and “Empty” keeps track of number of unoccupied slots. 
Initialization of semaphores – 
mutex = 1 
Full = 0 // Initially, all slots are empty. Thus full slots are 0  
Empty = 3 // All slots are empty initially  and Maximum Size of the buffer is 3. 
Give 3 choice to user 
1. producer 
2. consumer 
3. exit 
Smaple Input and output: 
1.Producer 
2.Consumer 
3.Exit 
Enter your choice:1 
Producer produces the item 1 
Enter your choice:1 
Producer produces the item 2 
Enter your choice:1 
Producer produces the item 3 
Enter your choice:1 
Buffer is full!! 
Enter your choice:2 
Consumer consumes item 3 
Enter your choice:2 
Consumer consumes item 2 
Enter your choice:2 

Consumer consumes item 1 
Enter your choice:2 
Buffer is empty!! 
Enter your choice:3
